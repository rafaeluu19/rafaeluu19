ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rafaeluu19. A biochemistry major studying at DePauw University. My goal after graduation is to pursue graduate school in the field of structural biology, biophysics,
or computational biophysics. Iâ€™m currently trying to improvde my computational skills and work on projects adjacent to computational biology! 

âš¡ Fun fact: When I am not studying or doing research, I am probably out for Chick-fil-A/Slim's Chicken, or playing some kind of civilization games.
